/*
 * The best way to map a @OneToMany relationship with JPA and Hibernate
 * 
 * https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-association-with-jpa-and-hibernate/
 * 
 * Conclusion:
 * As you will see in a future article, bidirectional collections are way better 
 * than unidirectional ones because they rely on the @ManyToOne association, which 
 * is always efficient in terms of generated SQL statements.
 * But then, even if they are very convenient, you donâ€™t always have to use collections. 
 * The @ManyToOne association is the most natural and also efficient way of mapping a 
 * one-to-many database relationship.
