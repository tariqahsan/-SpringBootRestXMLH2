/*
 * How to change the @OneToOne shared primary key column name with JPA and Hibernate
 * 
 * Just adding the JPA @OneToOne annotation in the child entity does not render a true 
 * one-to-one table relationship since a separate Foreign Key column will be used. 
 * Only when adding the @MapsId annotation will the JPA one-to-one association map to a 
 * real one-to-one table relationship.
 * 
 * The Post entity is the parent while the PostDetails is the child entity and its 
 * associated Primary Key is also a Foreign Key to the parent table Primary Key.
 * 
 * The Post entity is rather straightforward to map since it does not contain any association.

     * Notice that the Primary Key column name is called post_id in the post_details table, and this is not 
     * very nice since the Primary Key column name is called id in the post table.
	 * @JoinColumn to the rescue
	 * To fix this issue, we just have to add a @JoinColumn annotation to the @OneToOne association in the 
	 * PostDetails entity:
